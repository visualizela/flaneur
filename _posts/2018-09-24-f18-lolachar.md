New York City is the greatest city in the world. But since I’m now a resident of Los Angeles, I must put my preferences aside and settle for something that comes close enough. Koreatown, overlooking its names implications, houses many cultures and epitomizes a true city. This is because it’s central and populous, attractive to millenials, and undergoing gentrification due to the influx of new inhabitants. Koreatowns high population density and accessible transportation is a big contributor to its city-like atmosphere. It’s desired by a younger generation because of the ability to have an urban lifestyle, and Koreatowns wave of gentrification is stemming from its expense and increase in new development, which is also causing a displacement of the current residents.  

 One of the biggest differences between large cities and suburban communities is the population, specifically population density. Koreatown has a population of over 125,000 people and a density of approximately 43,000 people per square mile (Census Reporter). This makes Koreatown the densest neighborhood in Los Angeles and one of the densest cities in the entire country. Koreatowns high population density helps contribute to the feeling of living in a “true city”, and certainly makes it stand out from the other residential areas of Los Angeles. The Census Bureau identifies an “urbanized area” as an area with a population of 50,000 or more (Brasuell, 2012). By this definition, Los Angeles as a whole is clearly an urban community, but Koreatown as a neighborhood within Los Angeles is approaching that benchmark as well. Due to Koreatowns population, not only do they qualify as an actual urban city, but it helps make it feel like one as well.  
 
 As a New Yorker, the thing I dislike most about Los Angeles is how widespread the entire city is, and without a car, it’s nearly impossible to get around. My biggest gripe is the inconvenient public transportation; however, this is not the case in Koreatown. Los Angeles is notoriously a driving city. In a region of 13 million people, approximately only 360,000 people use the rail on an average weekday. Comparatively, New York state with a population of roughly 20 million, has around 5 million subways riders on an average weekday. Being a car owner can be extremely expensive and Los Angeles has been making huge efforts to upgrade the cities public transportation system as it’s becoming increasingly important for many people, particularly millennials (Panagiotopoulos, 2017). Koreatown was voted the eighth most fuel-efficient big neighborhood in the country because everything is in extremely close proximity. Almost everything can be done on foot which is an uncommon characteristic of most Angeleno neighborhoods (Loc, 2016). Koreatown is much more compact than the majority of other LA neighborhoods and the ability to get around by walking certainly alludes to similar characteristics found in what I, and many others consider to be a pinnacle city of the world, New York City. In addition to being walkable, Koreatown is in close proximity to three major freeways. It’s also close to Downtown LA, and is served by both the Red and Purple Line (Aron, 2017). Since Koreatown is an easily accessible city, it isn’t difficult for visitors to get in and out. It also makes it an appealing place to work and live and is a major source of its desirability as an up and coming community. Koreatown is regarded as a city within a city which can be largely attributed to its convenient transit, drawing in all kinds of people who are looking to become city dwellers. 
 
   In recent years, many young people desire an urban lifestyle in big cities which makes Koreatown an attractive place to live. Peter Strauss, Iconic Investments founder states that the changing demographics of Koreatown is driven by millenials. He says that most of them don’t have cars, so parking is less important to them since they have easy access to Uber and the Metro (Jordan, 2017). Since Koreatown is so easy to navigate, it makes it extremely popular for young people looking for a convenient, inexpensive lifestyle. The influx of younger resident leads to a busier and more city-like environment. 

It seems that as of recently, the hallmark of a great city is being way too expensive for the majority of Americans to afford, which is certainly true about Koreatown. In a conversation with an Uber driver who happened to live in Koreatown, he stated that Koreatown used to be a place where poor Koreans moved when they first immigrated to Los Angeles in order to be surrounded by familiar people, food and culture, and once they became wealthier they opted to leave be surrounded by other wealthy people. However, in 2018 Koreatown is no longer known as a place for “poor Koreans” and attracts people of all races and classes, which typically hurts those that have been living there for a long time. Koreatown is very multi-ethnic but is home to majority Latino immigrants. It is also known as one of the poorest areas of Los Angeles (Park & Kim, 2008) Koreatown is an extremely diverse neighborhood and actually has many non-Koreans in the community. Many of these minorities are lower middle class and struggle to afford living there. In 2008, “the cost of living in Koreatown is 140% higher compared to other major metropolitan areas in the U.S” (Park & Kim, 2008). Since Koreatown has become so expensive, many of the immigrants and poor minorities are no longer able to afford living there, and it’s certainly no longer a place for poor Korean immigrants to move to. It’s ironic that although Koreatown is so expensive, the majority of its residents can’t actually afford to live there anymore. 

Since Koreatown is Los Angeles’s latest up and coming neighborhood, it has become a hotspot for new development. LA Weekly writes, “There are no fewer than 30 new buildings proposed for Koreatown, according to Curbed LA, most of which are between 10 and 30 stories tall. Nearly all will include at least some housing” (Aron, 2017). Koreatown has all the amenities that any developer looking to cater to a younger, wealthier community is looking for. The increase in development further pushes Koreatown into being a main city center of Los Angeles. This development will bring jobs and much needed revenue to the poor neighborhood. However, research on the impact of these projects on the community that already lives and works there is scarce. There has also been very minimal effort to include any community members in the decision making process (Park & Kim, 2008) . Gentrification is an extremely tricky topic. In many ways, certain communities benefit from the influx of new residents, often resulting in upgraded conditions, resources and higher property values. However, it’s easy to fail to recognize the impact it has on more vulnerable members of the communities who are being neglected.
	
 With gentrification, comes displacement; there can’t be one without the other. Some individuals benefit from the raise in property values, while others suffer. My family experienced gentrification firsthand in our neighborhood in Brooklyn. Luckily, since we own our home, the changing neighborhood benefits us, skyrocketing the price of our home. However many of our neighbors were forced out of the area if they rented their home. It’s evident that there can be certain upside to gentrification, but depending on your situation, it can also be extremely disadvantageous.  Koreatown is located in the heart of Los Angeles and 1.5 miles from downtown, which makes it an ideal target for developers, which consequently ends up displacing many of the low-income members of the community (Park & Kim, 2008). Attorney Grace Yoo says, “Unless residents are living in units covered under the city's rent stabilization ordinance, they will have to move- because even the non–luxury units are going up in price” (Aron, 2017). The wave of new development is bringing new residents to the area and making it a more desirable place to live. This means the lower income communities that have lived there for many years will no longer be able to afford living there since landlords are now able to raise the prices. Although Koreatown is gaining popularity and more people want to live in the city, many people are negatively affected. Most up and coming cities undergo a similar effect from gentrification and Koreatown is the next victim.  

Koreatown is becoming the true heart of Los Angeles and has its own bustling city-like environment of its own. Koreatown has an extremely high population density and great public transportation which helps make it feel like a big city. It’s also extremely attracted to younger populations due to the urban lifestyle that comes alongside living there. In addition to this, Koreatown is facing extreme gentrification, as most populous cities do, and the increase in development is in turn is displacing many of the longstanding communities that have lived there. Koreatown is an extremely diverse neighborhood and is becoming the nucleus of Los Angeles due to its central and populated location, it’s desired by a young generation and is facing gentrification due to its popularity. As a very proud New Yorker, I have extremely high standards wherever I go, and I’ve finally found a city that is comparable in Los Angeles, Koreatown.
