### 1991 LA Planning Documents
* The maps and images seen on this website were digitized and georeferenced by Jack Tieszen under the advising of Andy Rutkowski.
* The planning Documents were provided by the University of Southern California's VKC Library.

#### Jekyll theme
* Fl√¢neur is based on my earlier mapping and texts framework, [Boulevardier](https://github.com/kirschbombe/boulevardier). The framework was ported to Jekyll by [Dawn Childress](https://github.com/kirschbombe) and [Niqui O'Neill](https://github.com/dnoneill).


#### Icons
* _Map Marker_ icon created by Berkay Sargin from the Noun Project
* _north_ by Lluisa Iborra from the Noun Project
